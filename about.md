Arcadus is a work in progress gaming platform, allowing anyone to create a game without knowing much about programming.

## Motive

I learned how to program from games such as Furcadia, Roblox and Garry's Mod. I want to inspire the next generation of programmers by allowing them to create modern games, with a low bar of entry and little programming skills.
